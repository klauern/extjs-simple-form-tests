Form Testing with ExtJS
=======================

This is a simple example that demonstrates two things:

   # Using [Sinatra][1] to handle simple services for testing
   # Using [ExtJS][2] and [Ext Designer][3] to handle and create Forms.

I had a heck of a time trying to map many of the Ext JS examples over to how their Designer
creates it's own UI and event handler .js files.  Since most examples showed how to create
a form and subsequently add a function, I wanted to find a simple example of how to do that
when Ext Designer pushes the UI out and requires you to pull it in and add handlers afterwards.

I found [one comment in a forum post][4] that answered my question immediately and I knew if I didn't 
at least write this down somewhere, I wouldn't remember nor find it.
